# Performatrix (Student Performance Dashboard)

## Overview

The Student Performance Dashboard is a data visualization project that analyzes the academic performance of students over multiple semesters. It generates informative visualizations, including bar plots and pie charts, to help educators and administrators gain insights into student marks distribution and their pass/fail status.

- Simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to easily interpret the student performance data.

## Data Source

The student performance data is sourced from the 'data.xlsx' file.

## Overview
